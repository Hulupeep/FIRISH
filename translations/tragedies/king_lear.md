# King Lear - Firish Translation
## Storm and Fool Scenes - Simple Words, Heavy Meaning

### Act III, Scene ii - The Storm Scene (Irish Cadence, Simple Profundity)

**LEAR** *(on the heath, raging against the storm with Irish rhythms)*
Blow, winds, and crack your cheeks! Séid, a ghaoth mhór! Rage, blow, you cataracts and hurricanes, spout till you have drenched our steeples, drowned the cocks!

*[Irish curse patterns]*
You sulphurous and thought-executing fires, vaunt-couriers to oak-cleaving thunderbolts, singe my white head! Dóigh mo cheann bán! And thou, all-shaking thunder, smite flat the thick rotundity o' th' world!

**FOOL** *(entering, simple Irish wisdom)*
Ó, a uncail, nuncle, court holy water in a dry house is better than this rainwater out o' door. Good nuncle, in - ask thy daughters' blessing! Here's a night pities neither wise man nor fool.

**LEAR** *(Irish elemental fury)*
Rumble thy bellyful! Spit, fire! Spout, rain! Nor rain, wind, thunder, fire are my daughters. I tax not you, you elements, with unkindness - ní chuirim i leith oraibh... I don't blame ye. I never gave you kingdom, called you children!

**KENT** *(simple English practicality)*
Good my lord, enter here. The tyranny of the open night's too rough for nature to endure.

**LEAR** *(Irish philosophical insight)*
Let the great gods that keep this dreadful pother o'er our heads find out their enemies now. Tremble, thou wretch, that hast within thee undivulged crimes! Close pent-up guilts, rive your concealing continents and cry these dreadful summoners grace!

*[Simple Irish truth]*
I am a man more sinned against than sinning, duine a ndearnadh peaca ina choinne níos mó ná a rinne sé peaca.

**FOOL** *(Irish folk wisdom)*
Marry, here's grace and a codpiece - that's a wise man and a fool. A spéir-bhean agus amadán - a wise woman and a fool!

*[Singing in Irish traditional pattern]*
"He that has and a little tiny wit,
With hey, ho, the wind and the rain,
Must make content with his fortunes fit,
For the rain it raineth every day."

### Act I, Scene iv - Fool's First Appearance (Simple Truth-Telling)

**LEAR** *(after Goneril's rejection, Irish bewilderment)*
Does any here know me? This is not Lear. Does Lear walk thus? Speak thus? Where are his eyes? Either his notion weakens, or his discernings are lethargied.

*[Irish confusion]*
Cé mise? Who am I? Wake me not in my sleep! Lear's shadow? Who is it that can tell me who I am?

**FOOL** *(entering with simple Irish truth)*
Lear's shadow, a scáth Lear. I am better than thou art now. I am a fool - is amadán mé. Thou art nothing. Níl tú ar bith - you are nothing.

**LEAR** *(not understanding)*
Your name, fair gentlewoman?

**FOOL** *(simple wisdom in Irish)*
This fool usurps my name. An amadán seo - he steals my name. The lord that counselled thee to give away thy land, come place him here by me. Do thou for him stand - seas anseo. The sweet and bitter fool will presently appear, the one in motley here, the other found out there.

**LEAR** *(growing anger)*
Dost thou call me fool, boy?

**FOOL** *(Irish folk pattern - call and response)*
All thy other titles thou hast given away. That thou wast born with - sin a rugadh leat é, that you were born with.

*[Singing traditional Irish style]*
"Have more than thou showest,
Speak less than thou knowest,
Lend less than thou owest,
Ride more than thou goest,
Learn more than thou trowest,
Set less than thou throwest - 
Leave thy drink and thy whore
And keep in-a-door,
And thou shalt have more
Than two tens to a score."

**KENT** *(appreciating the wisdom)*
This is nothing, fool.

**FOOL** *(Irish wit)*
Then 'tis like the breath of an unfeed lawyer - you gave me nothing for't. Can you make no use of nothing, nuncle?

**LEAR** *(Irish frustration)*
Why, no, boy. Nothing can be made out of nothing. Ní féidir rud ar bith a dhéanamh as neamhní.

**FOOL** *(sharp Irish logic)*
Prithee tell him, so much the rent of his land comes to. He will not believe a fool. Ní chreidfidh sé amadán.

*[To audience, Irish traditional warning]*
"Nuncles, I can tell you what I learned from the cuckoo: never give your heart away with your property - ná tabhair do chroí le d'achmhainn. Keep your heart and you'll keep your head. Mark it, nuncles:
   
   That lord that counseled thee
   To give away thy land,
   Come place him here by me - 
   Do thou for him stand.
   
   The sweet and bitter fool
   Will presently appear:
   The one in motley here - anseo,
   The other found out there - ansiúd."

**GONERIL** *(entering with cold French aristocratic authority)*
Non seulement, Monsieur - not only, sir - ce bouffon que vous autorisez à tout dire - this your all-licensed fool - mais d'autres de votre suite insolente - but other of your insolent retinue - ne cessent de critiquer et de se quereller - do hourly carp and quarrel - éclatant en émeutes grossières et intolérables - breaking forth in rank and not-to-be-endured riots.

**FOOL** *(aside to Lear, Irish warning)*
For you know, nuncle, "The hedge-sparrow fed the cuckoo so long that it's had it head bit off by it young." So out went the candle, and we were left darkling - fágadh san dorchadas sinn.

**LEAR** *(Irish bewilderment confronting French coldness)*
Êtes-vous notre fille? - are you our daughter? - an í ár n-iníon tú?

**GONERIL** *(French aristocratic condescension)*
Venez, Monsieur - come, sir - je voudrais que vous fassiez usage de cette bonne sagesse - I would you would make use of that good wisdom - dont je sais que vous êtes pourvu - whereof I know you are fraught - et que vous écartiez ces dispositions - and put away these dispositions - qui dernièrement vous transforment - that of late transform you - de ce que vous êtes réellement - from what you rightly are.

**FOOL** *(Irish truth to power)*
May not an ass know when the cart draws the horse? *[to Lear]* Whoop, Jug, I love thee! But tell me, nuncle, can you tell how an oyster makes his shell?

**LEAR**
No.

**FOOL** *(Irish parable)*
Nor I neither. But I can tell why a snail has a house - is féidir liom a rá cén fáth a bhfuil teach ag seilide.

**LEAR**
Why?

**FOOL** *(simple Irish wisdom)*
Why, to put's head in, not to give it away to his daughters and leave his horns without a case. Chun a cheann a chur isteach ann, not to give it to his daughters!
