## ðŸŽ¯ **Best Option for Firish: Google Colab FREE**

### **Why Colab is Perfect:**
- **T5-small fine-tuning takes:** ~1-3 hours
- **Colab free GPU time:** ~12 hours/day
- **Our dataset size:** ~200-500 examples (small, fast training)
- **Memory needed:** ~2-4GB (T4 has 16GB)

### **Colab Setup Process:**
```python
# 1. Open colab.research.google.com
# 2. Runtime â†’ Change runtime type â†’ GPU â†’ T4
# 3. Install requirements
!pip install transformers datasets torch

# 4. Upload our training data
from google.colab import files
files.upload()  # Upload our firish_training.json

# 5. Run fine-tuning (1-3 hours)
# 6. Save model to Google Drive
```

## ðŸ›  **Step-by-Step Colab Plan**

### **Phase 1: Prepare Locally (I'll do this)**
1. Create training dataset from our authentic examples
2. Format for T5 fine-tuning 
3. Create Colab notebook with complete training code
4. Test data loading and preprocessing

### **Phase 2: Colab Training (You run this)**
1. Open our prepared Colab notebook
2. Upload training data (small file, <1MB)
3. Run training cells (2-3 hours, can leave running)
4. Download fine-tuned model

### **Phase 3: Integration (I'll help)**
1. Load fine-tuned model in our Firish tools
2. Create hybrid LLM + rule validation system
3. Compare with rule-based CLI

## ðŸŽ¯ **My Recommendation**

### **Best Path Forward:**
1. **Start with Colab Free** - Perfect for our needs, zero cost
2. **I'll create the complete Colab notebook** with training pipeline
3. **You run it once** (2-3 hours, can leave running)
4. **We get fine-tuned Firish model** ready to use
5. **If you like it, consider Colab Pro** for future models

### **Backup Options:**
- **Kaggle** if Colab limits hit
- **RunPod** if you want faster training (~$1-2)
- **Hugging Face AutoTrain** if you prefer GUI

**Google Colab Free gives us everything we need to fine-tune T5-small for authentic Firish translation at zero cost!**

Should I create the complete Colab training notebook and dataset preparation?
