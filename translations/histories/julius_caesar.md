# Julius Caesar - Firish Translation
## Forum Speeches - Rhetorical Call-and-Response

### Act III, Scene ii - The Forum Speeches

#### Brutus's Speech (Formal Rhetoric - French for Elevated Oratory)

**BRUTUS** *(mounting the pulpit with formal French dignity)*
Citoyens de Rome! Citizens! Listen to me with silence, that you may hear. *[pause for effect]* Believe me for mine honor, and have respect for mine honor that you may believe.

*[Call-and-response pattern beginning]*
If there be any in this assembly, any dear friend of Caesar's, to him I say that Brutus's love to Caesar was no less than his...

**FIRST PLEBEIAN** *(in English, working-class directness)*
We'll hear him! Let him speak!

**BRUTUS** *(continuing in elevated French-English mix)*
Censure me in your wisdom, and awake your senses, that you may the better judge. S'il y avait quelqu'un here who loved Caesar less than I, let him speak - car je ne l'ai pas offensé, I have not wronged him!

S'il y avait quelqu'un in this assembly, any dear friend of Caesar's, to him I say: Brutus's love to Caesar was no less than his. If then that friend demand why Brutus rose against Caesar, this is my answer: Not that I loved Caesar less, but que j'aimais Rome davantage - that I loved Rome more!

**SECOND PLEBEIAN** *(Irish working-class response)*
That's fair enough, so it is! He loved Rome better!

**BRUTUS** *(formal peroration)*
Had you rather Caesar were living and die all slaves, than that Caesar were dead, to live all free men? As Caesar loved me, I weep for him. As he was fortunate, I rejoice at it. As he was valiant, je l'honore. But as he was ambitious, I slew him!

There are tears for his love, joy for his fortune, honor for his valor, and death for his ambition. Qui ici est si vil qu'il voudrait être esclave? Who here is so vile that will not love his country?

*[Pause for response]*

**ALL PLEBEIANS** *(mixed languages showing unity)*
None, Brutus, none! Ninguno! Personne!

#### Antony's Speech (Emotional Appeal - Irish for Heart, English for Clarity)

**ANTONY** *(entering humbly, Irish affecting common touch)*
Mo chairde, Romans, countrymen, lend me your ears! I come to bury Caesar, not to praise him. The evil that men do lives after them; the good is oft interred with their bones - so let it be with Caesar.

*[Building emotional connection through Irish]*
The noble Brutus hath told you Caesar was ambitious. If it were so, it was a grievous fault, and grievously hath Caesar answered it. Here, under leave of Brutus and the rest - for Brutus is an honorable man, so are they all, na fir onóracha iad go léir, all honorable men - come I to speak in Caesar's funeral.

**THIRD PLEBEIAN** *(responding to emotional tone)*
Poor soul, his eyes are red as fire with weeping!

**ANTONY** *(Irish intimacy building)*
A stór, he was my friend, faithful and just to me. But Brutus says he was ambitious, and Brutus is an honorable man. Caesar did bring many captives home to Rome, whose ransoms did the general coffers fill. Did this in Caesar seem ambitious?

When that the poor have cried, Caesar hath wept - bhí deora ina shúile, tears in his eyes for the suffering of the people. Ambition should be made of sterner stuff. Yet Brutus says he was ambitious, and Brutus is an honorable man.

*[Voice rising with Irish passion]*
You all did see that on the Lupercal I thrice presented him a kingly crown, which he did thrice refuse. Was this ambition? Yet Brutus says he was ambitious, and sure he is an honorable man!

**FOURTH PLEBEIAN** *(Irish emotional response)*
There's reason in his sayings! Mo Dhia, the man speaks sense!

**ANTONY** *(Irish grief becoming universal)*
A mhuintir, my people, mo chairde... bear with me. Mo chroí is in the coffin there with Caesar, and I must pause till it come back to me.

*[Long pause - the crowd murmurs in mixed languages]*

**FIRST PLEBEIAN** *(in Irish, moved)*
Tá an ceart aige - he's right! Caesar was no ambitious man!

**ANTONY** *(reading the will, strategic Irish intimacy)*
But yesterday, the word of Caesar might have stood against the world. Now lies he there, and none so poor to do him reverence. Ó, mo mháistrí! If I were disposed to stir your hearts and minds to mutiny and rage, I should do Brutus wrong, and Cassius wrong, who - you all know - are honorable men.

I will not do them wrong. I rather choose to wrong the dead, to wrong myself and you, than I will wrong such honorable men. But here's a parchment with the seal of Caesar - I found it in his closet - tá sé anseo, 'tis his will!

**ALL PLEBEIANS** *(crescendo of mixed languages)*
The will! The will! We will hear Caesar's will! Léigh é! Read it! Lisez-le!

**ANTONY** *(Irish cunning with feigned reluctance)*
Have patience, gentle friends - foighne, a stór. I must not read it. It is not meet you know how Caesar loved you. You are not wood, you are not stones, but men - daoine! And being men, hearing the will of Caesar, it will inflame you, it will make you mad!

*[The crowd roars for the will]*

'Tis good you know not that you are his heirs, for if you should - ó, a Dhia, what would come of it!

## Translation Notes:

**Rhetorical Register Patterns:**
- **Brutus**: Formal French establishes aristocratic authority, logical appeal
- **Antony**: Irish emotional connection, working-class appeal, then strategic manipulation
- **Plebeians**: Authentic working-class multilingual responses

**Public Oratory Techniques:**
- **Call-and-response**: Natural trilingual crowd dynamics
- **Emotional escalation**: Irish for heart appeal vs French for mind appeal
- **Class distinction**: Language choices reveal speaker's relationship to audience

**Political Language Strategy:**
- **Brutus**: "Noble" French distances him from crowd, emphasizes logic
- **Antony**: Irish familiarity creates false intimacy, manipulates through emotion
- **Code-switching**: Antony adapts to crowd's language, Brutus maintains distance

**Performance Notes:**
- Staging should show crowd's linguistic/emotional shift from Brutus to Antony
- Actors playing plebeians must represent authentic multilingual working class
- Antony's manipulation enhanced by strategic language choices
- Forum acoustics require clear delivery across three languages
- Political themes enhanced by authentic Irish historical context of resistance rhetoric
