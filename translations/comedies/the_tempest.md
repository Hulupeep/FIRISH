# The Tempest - Firish Translation
## Magic and Master-Servant Dynamics

### Act I, Scene ii - Prospero's Story to Miranda (Formal vs Tender Registers)

**PROSPERO** *(beginning formally in French, as befits a duke)*
Ma fille, ma chère Miranda, le temps est venu - the time has come for you to know more of your history than you yet know.

**MIRANDA** *(respectfully, matching his French)*
Papa, you've often begun to tell me what I am, but always stopped... pourquoi? Why do you hold back?

**PROSPERO** *(warming, switching to Irish fatherly affection)*
A stór mo chroí, my heart's treasure, it's not an easy story to tell. Twelve years ago - bliain dhéag ó shin - your father was the Duke of Milan, and a mighty prince, an prionsa cumhachtach.

**MIRANDA**
A prince? But Papa, what storm has brought us to this island? That ship we just saw wrecked - na daoine bochta, the poor people!

**PROSPERO** *(switching to English for the serious political story)*
Sit down, daughter, and listen well. That ship contained my enemies - na naimhde a rinne ár ndíbearú, the enemies who caused our exile. 

*[Growing more emotional, Irish breaking through]*
I had a brother, Antonio - mo dheartháir féin! - who I trusted more than any man alive. I gave him control of my dukedom while I studied... while I learned the arts you see me practice now.

**MIRANDA** *(in Irish, sensing his pain)*
Agus cad a rinne sé? And what did he do?

**PROSPERO** *(bitter, mixing languages with emotion)*
He betrayed me! With the King of Naples - le Roi de Naples - he conspired to steal my dukedom. One dark night, they put us in a rotten boat - i mbád lobhta - and set us to sea to die!

**MIRANDA** *(Irish compassion)*
A Dhia na glóire! How did we survive, Papa?

**PROSPERO** *(tenderly, pure Irish now)*
Á, a stór, there was one good soul among them - Gonzalo, an old lord who took pity on us. He gave us water, food, and most precious of all - *[gesturing to his books]* - mo leabhair draíochta, my books of magic.

### Act V, Scene i - Prospero Releases Ariel (Magic Lexicon and Farewell)

**ARIEL** *(appearing, speaking in the mystical Irish traditionally associated with the aos sí)*
A mháistir, master mine, I have done your bidding. The ship's crew sleeps safe - codlann siad go sábháilte - and your enemies repent their crimes.

**PROSPERO** *(formal French, but beginning to soften)*
Mon brave esprit, my brave Ariel, you have served me faithfully these seven years. But tell me true - do you love me?

**ARIEL** *(simple Irish truth)*
Love you? A mháistir... you freed me from that pine tree where the witch Sycorax had trapped me. Sin seacht mbliana, for seven years you've been kind... but mo chroí, my heart longs for freedom like the wind longs for the sky.

**PROSPERO** *(switching to Irish, emotional decision)*
And you shall have it, a stór. Tá do shaoirse tuillte agat - your freedom is earned. *[removing his robe]* But first, help me with one last task.

*[Ariel helps him put away his magic books]*

**PROSPERO** *(to his books, in French - the language of his learning)*
Mes livres précieux, my precious books... je vous abandonne. I renounce you all. *[switching to Irish for the personal sacrifice]* Slán libh, goodbye forever.

*[To Ariel]*
A chara dhíl, dear friend, take my magic staff - mo shlat draíochta - and break it. Cast it in the deep sea where it can harm none.

**ARIEL** *(gently)*
Master... a mháistir... are you certain? Your power - do chumhacht...

**PROSPERO** *(firmly, but kindly)*
My power was to reunite my family and forgive my enemies. That's done now. Go, mo chroí geal, bright heart - fly free as you were meant to. Seas saor, be free!

**ARIEL** *(joy and gratitude mixing)*
Saor! Saor at last! But before I go... *[kissing Prospero's forehead]* Míle buíochas, a thousand thanks, kind master. May the winds carry you safely home to Milano!

*[Ariel flies away singing in Irish]*
"Téir go mall, téir go bog,
Home across the deep sea,
Slán go fóill, farewell for now,
Till the spirits meet again!"

**PROSPERO** *(alone, to the audience)*
Now my charms are all o'erthrown, and what strength I have's mine own - which is most faint. But you, dear audience, can set me free with your applause. As you from crimes would pardoned be, let your indulgence set me free.

*[In Irish, as he looks toward home]*
Abhaile... homeward now, le cúnamh Dé, with God's help.

## Translation Notes:

**Magic Lexicon Development:**
- **Irish for mystical/supernatural**: Traditional association with aos sí (fairy folk)
- **French for learned magic**: Academic, ducal education
- **English for reality/political power**: Practical world concerns

**Master-Servant Register Evolution:**
- **Formal beginning**: French maintains ducal dignity
- **Emotional revelation**: Irish for personal/family pain
- **Tender farewell**: Irish affection transcends power dynamic

**Character Linguistic Patterns:**
- **Prospero**: French (duke), Irish (father/man), English (politics)
- **Miranda**: Respectful French, then Irish compassion
- **Ariel**: Mystical Irish, but understands all languages

**Supernatural Element Integration:**
- Weather magic invoked in Irish (traditional storm association)
- Books/learning referenced in French (intellectual tradition)
- Freedom/forgiveness expressed in Irish (emotional truth)

**Performance Notes:**
- Prospero's costume changes should mirror language shifts
- Ariel's ethereal Irish creates otherworldly atmosphere
- Magic effects enhanced by traditional Irish mystical vocabulary
- Audience connection maintained through trilingual accessibility
- Final soliloquy mixing all three shows complete character integration
