# üìã Firish Next Actions & Roadmap

*Created by Colm Byrne - Last updated: September 2025*

## üéØ Immediate Priority Actions

### 1. AI Model Improvement (HIGH PRIORITY)
- [ ] **Expand training dataset** from 25 to 100+ authentic examples
  - Collect real code-switching patterns from multilingual families
  - Document authentic Irish diaspora communication patterns
  - Create diverse context scenarios (parents/kids, travel, privacy levels)
  
- [ ] **Fix model accuracy issues** 
  - Current issue: Model generating German instead of proper Firish
  - Need better training on French-Irish-English patterns specifically
  - Improve context parameter handling (situation/audience/opacity)

- [ ] **Implement evaluation metrics**
  - BLEU scores against authentic Firish examples
  - Human evaluation of naturalness and authenticity
  - Comparison metrics between rule-based and LLM approaches

### 2. Training Data Collection (COMMUNITY HELP NEEDED)
- [ ] **Document authentic patterns** from multilingual families
- [ ] **Create conversation datasets** for different contexts:
  - Family coordination ("t√©igim√≠s shopping" vs "nous besoin aller courses")
  - Public privacy ("an bhfuil t√∫ ready?" vs "es-tu pr√™t-ach?")
  - Travel situations (Irish people abroad maintaining connections)
  
- [ ] **Validate existing patterns** with native speakers
- [ ] **Expand to other language combinations** (Spanish-Irish-English, etc.)

## üîß Technical Improvements

### 3. Tool Enhancement
- [ ] **Hybrid translation approach**
  - Combine rule-based fallback with LLM enhancement
  - Use EASE algorithm when LLM confidence is low
  - Smart switching between approaches based on context

- [ ] **Better CLI interface**
  - Interactive mode improvements
  - Batch processing capabilities
  - Integration with translation workflows

- [ ] **Web interface** for easier access and contribution

### 4. Quality Assurance
- [ ] **Comprehensive testing framework**
  - Automated testing of translation consistency
  - Regression testing for model updates
  - Quality metrics tracking

- [ ] **Validation tools**
  - Community review system for new translations
  - Authenticity scoring system
  - Pattern consistency checking

## üìö Documentation & Community

### 5. Learning Resources
- [ ] **Expanded learning materials**
  - Video pronunciation guides
  - Interactive exercises
  - Context-specific phrase collections

- [ ] **Academic documentation**
  - Linguistic analysis of code-switching patterns
  - Computational methods documentation
  - Research paper on cryptolect preservation

### 6. Community Building
- [ ] **Contribution guidelines**
  - Clear process for adding training examples
  - Style guide for authentic patterns
  - Review process for new content

- [ ] **Community engagement**
  - Discord/forum for discussions
  - Regular pattern-sharing sessions
  - Feedback collection from multilingual families

## üöÄ Advanced Features (Future)

### 7. Extended Capabilities
- [ ] **Multi-modal support**
  - Audio generation (text-to-speech)
  - Gesture/cultural context integration
  - Regional dialect variations

- [ ] **Advanced AI features**
  - Context-aware conversation memory
  - Personality adaptation (formal/informal)
  - Real-time conversation assistance

### 8. Research Applications
- [ ] **Academic collaborations**
  - Partner with linguistics departments
  - Code-switching research publications
  - Cryptolect preservation methodology

- [ ] **Cultural preservation**
  - Archive authentic multilingual family patterns
  - Document Irish diaspora communication
  - Preserve disappearing language-mixing practices
