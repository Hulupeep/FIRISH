# Macbeth - Firish Translation
## Psychological Drama - Stage Whispers and Interior Torment

### Act II, Scene i - The Dagger Soliloquy (Interior Irish, External English)

**MACBETH** *(alone, midnight - interior thoughts in Irish, external reality in English)*
Is this a dagger which I see before me, an scian seo, the handle toward my hand? Come, let me clutch thee...

*[reaching out, then recoiling]*
I have thee not, and yet I see thee still. Feicim thú fós - I see you still. Art thou not, fatal vision, sensible to feeling as to sight? Or art thou but a dagger of the mind, scian den intinn, a false creation proceeding from the heat-oppressèd brain?

*[Irish whispers - his true thoughts]*
Tá mé ag dul as mo mheabhair... I'm going out of my mind. An bhfeicim é i ndáiríre? Do I really see it? 

*[English - trying to rationalize]*
I see thee yet, in form as palpable as this which now I draw. *[drawing his real dagger]* Thou marshall'st me the way that I was going, and such an instrument I was to use.

*[Irish psychological torment]*
Ó, mo Dhia, what am I about to do? Cad atá mé ar tí a dhéanamh? Duncan - an rí maith, the good king - sleeping under my roof, trusting in my hospitality...

*[English - the external world creeping in]*
Mine eyes are made the fools o' th' other senses, or else worth all the rest. I see thee still, and on thy blade and dudgeon gouts of blood, which was not so before.

*[Irish terror and fascination]*
Fuil! Blood! Tá fuil ar an scian! There's blood on the knife! There's no such thing - níl a leithéid ann! It is the bloody business which informs thus to mine eyes.

*[Bell tolls - external reality]*
Now o'er the one half-world nature seems dead, and wicked dreams abuse the curtained sleep. 

*[Irish - his cultural understanding of the supernatural]*
Tá na taibhsí ag siúl anocht - the spirits are walking tonight. Witchcraft celebrates pale Hecate's offerings, and withered murder, alarumed by his sentinel the wolf, whose howl's his watch, thus with his stealthy pace moves like a ghost toward his design.

*[The bell again - decision made in English]*
I go, and it is done. The bell invites me. Hear it not, Duncan, for it is a knell that summons thee to heaven or to hell.

*[Irish prayer as he exits]*
Dia ár sábháil - God save us all.

### Act V, Scene i - Lady Macbeth Sleepwalking (Unconscious Irish Truth)

*[Enter Lady Macbeth with a taper, walking in her sleep]*

**GENTLEWOMAN** *(to Doctor, in hushed English)*
Lo you, here she comes. This is her very guise, and upon my life, fast asleep. Observe her - stand close.

**DOCTOR** *(whispered French - medical observation)*
Comment elle marche... how she walks... This is indeed a great perturbation in nature, to receive at once the benefit of sleep and do the effects of watching.

**LADY MACBETH** *(in sleep, unconscious Irish emerging)*
Fágaim anseo é... I leave it here... Yet here's a spot. *[rubbing her hands]*

**DOCTOR** *(in French, professional)*
Écoutez! Elle parle. I will set down what comes from her to satisfy my remembrance the more strongly.

**LADY MACBETH** *(Irish unconscious guilt)*
Amach, amach, damn spot! Out, I say! One, two - why then, 'tis time to do't. Hell is murky. Fie, mo thighearna, my lord, fie, a soldier and afeard?

*[English returning - her conscious persona fighting through]*
What need we fear who knows it, when none can call our power to accompany? Yet who would have thought the old man to have had so much blood in him?

**DOCTOR** *(awed whisper in French)*
Mon Dieu, she speaks of terrible things...

**LADY MACBETH** *(Irish guilt breaking through)*
An Thane of Fife had a wife - bhí bean ag Thane Fife. Where is she now? What, will these hands ne'er be clean?

*[Anguished Irish]*
Níl stop ar fhail air - there's no stopping it! No more o' that, my lord, no more o' that. You mar all with this starting.

**GENTLEWOMAN** *(Irish sympathy)*
Go directly, a bhean bhoicht - poor woman. Her heart is sorely charged.

**LADY MACBETH** *(Irish maternal grief)*
Here's the smell of the blood still - boladh na fola fós. All the perfumes of Arabia will not sweeten this little hand. Oh, oh, oh!

**DOCTOR** *(French professional concern)*
What a sigh is there! The heart is sorely charged.

**LADY MACBETH** *(final Irish - childlike)*
Wash your hands, nigh suas do lámha, put on your nightgown, look not so pale. I tell you yet again, Duncan's in his grave. After life's fitful fever he sleeps well.

*[Irish lullaby emerging]*
Codail go sámh, codail go sámh... sleep peacefully, sleep peacefully...

*[Exiting, still in sleep]*
Come, come, come, come, give me your hand. What's done cannot be undone. To bed, to bed, to bed.

**DOCTOR** *(crossing himself, in French and then Irish prayer)*
Dieu nous garde... More needs she the divine than the physician. Dia ár sábháil - God save us all. Remove from her the means of all annoyance, and still keep eyes upon her.

**GENTLEWOMAN** *(Irish compassion)*
Good night, good doctor. Tá mo chroí briste - my heart is broken for her.
