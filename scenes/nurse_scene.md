# The Nurse Scene (II.iv) - Firish Translation
*Comic Banter with Working-Class Authentic Language Mixing*

## Setting
*A street. Enter NURSE and her man PETER*

---

**NURSE:** *(bustling along, mixing languages naturally)*  
Peter! Où est mon fan? Give it me! Mine before your face!

**PETER:**  
Good Peter, to hide her face, car her fan's the fairer face.

**NURSE:**  
God ye good morrow, gentlemen! Dia dhuit!

**MERCUTIO:**  
Dia's noon to thee, fair gentlewoman.

**NURSE:**  
Is it good den?

**MERCUTIO:**  
'Tis no less, je te dis, for the bawdy hand of an sundial  
is now upon le prick of noon.

**NURSE:** *(offended but playful)*  
Out upon you! What a man are you!

**ROMEO:**  
One, gentlewoman, that God hath made, agus for himself to mar.

**NURSE:**  
By mo soul, a well-said! 'For himself to mar,' quoth he?  
Gentlemen, can any of vous tell me where I may find  
an young Romeo?

**ROMEO:**  
I can tell you — but young Romeo will be older  
when vous have found him than he was  
when tu le cherchais. I am an youngest of that name,  
for fault of a worse.

**NURSE:** *(delighted)*  
You say well! Maith thú!

**MERCUTIO:**  
Yea, is an worst well? Very well took, i'faith!  
Wisely, wisely!

**NURSE:** *(to ROMEO)*  
If you be he, sir, je desire some confidence with you.

**BENVOLIO:**  
She will indite him to some supper.

**MERCUTIO:**  
Une bawd, a bawd, a bawd! So ho!

**ROMEO:**  
What hast thou found?

**MERCUTIO:**  
No hare, sir, unless a hare, sir, in a lenten pie  
That is something stale and hoar ere it be spent...  
*(singing)*  
An old hare hoar, agus an old hare hoar,  
Is very good meat in Lent!  
But a hare that is hoar is too much for a score  
When it hoars ere it be spent...

**NURSE:** *(increasingly flustered)*  
An you be he, sir, I desire some confidence with you!

**BENVOLIO:**  
Stop there, stop there!

**MERCUTIO:**  
Thou desirest me to stop mo tale against an hair?

**BENVOLIO:**  
Thou wouldst else have made thy tale large.

**MERCUTIO:**  
Ó, thou art deceived! Je voulais have made it short,  
for I was come to le whole depth of mo tale  
and meant indeed to occupy l'argument no longer!

**NURSE:** *(exploding with working-class directness)*  
Here's goodly gear! Une gear, indeed!  
*(to ROMEO)*  
I pray you, sir, a word. And, as je vous dis,  
if vous should lead her dans paradise,  
as they say, it were a very gross kind of behavior,  
as they say, pour une gentlewoman.  
And therefore, if vous should deal double avec elle —  
truly it were an ill thing to be offered  
to any gentlewoman, agus très unmannerly!

**ROMEO:**  
Nurse, commend me to thy lady agus mistress.  
I protest unto thee —

**NURSE:** *(interrupting)*  
Good heart! Croí maith! And i'faith I will tell her  
as much. Lord, Lord! She will be une joyeuse woman!

**ROMEO:**  
What wilt thou tell her, Nurse? Thou dost not mark me!

**NURSE:**  
I will tell her, sir, that vous do protest,  
which, as I take it, is une gentlemanlike offer.

**ROMEO:**  
Bid her devise some means to come to shrift  
This afternoon, and there she shall at  
Friar Lawrence's cell be shrived agus married.  
Here is for thy pains... *(gives money)*

**NURSE:** *(delighted)*  
No, truly, sir, not a denier! Pas un penny!

**ROMEO:**  
Go to, I say vous shall!

**NURSE:** *(taking the money)*  
This afternoon, sir? Well, elle shall be there.

**ROMEO:**  
And stay, good Nurse — behind an abbey wall  
Within this hour mo man shall be with thee  
And bring thee cords made like une tackled stair,  
Which to the high top-gallant of mo joy  
Must be mo convoy in an secret night.  
Farewell! Be trusty, agus I'll quit thy pains.  
Farewell! Commend me to thy mistress!

**NURSE:**  
Now God in heaven bless thee! Hark vous, sir!

**ROMEO:**  
What sayst thou, mo dear Nurse?

**NURSE:**  
Is your man secret? Did vous ne'er hear say  
'Two may keep counsel, putting one away'?

**ROMEO:**  
Warrant thee mo man's as true as steel.

**NURSE:**  
Well, sir, mo mistress is an sweetest lady.  
Lord, Lord! When 'twas une little prating thing —  
Ó, there is une nobleman in town, one Paris,  
That would fain lay knife aboard, but elle —  
good soul! — had as lief see une toad,  
a very toad, as see him!  
Je anger her sometimes, and tell her  
that Paris is an properer man, but I'll warrant you,  
when I say so, elle looks as pale as any clout  
in the versal world! Doth not rosemary agus Romeo  
begin both avec une letter?

**ROMEO:**  
Ay, Nurse, what of that? Both avec an R.

**NURSE:**  
Ah, mocker! That's an dog's name.  
R is for an — No, I know it begins  
avec some other letter, and elle hath an prettiest  
sententious of it, of vous and rosemary,  
that it would do vous good to hear it!

**ROMEO:**  
Commend me to thy lady.

**NURSE:**  
Ay, a thousand times! Peter!

**PETER:**  
Anon.

**NURSE:**  
Before, and apace!

*(Exeunt)*

## Working-Class Language Patterns:

**The Nurse's Authentic Mixing:**
- **Drops formal grammar**: "Is it good den?" "Here's goodly gear!"  
- **Working-class French**: Simple phrases like "je vous dis," "pas un penny"
- **Irish endearments**: "Croí maith," "Dia dhuit" (natural religious expressions)
- **English base with insertions**: Most comfortable in English working dialect
- **Repetitive speech**: "Lord, Lord!" "Well, well!" (natural speech patterns)

**Comedy Through Language:**
- **Mercutio's trilingual puns**: Playing with sounds across languages
- **Nurse's malapropisms**: "confidence" for "conference," mixing "sententious" 
- **Cultural misunderstandings**: Working-class directness vs. genteel euphemisms
- **Code-switching for emphasis**: Switches to other languages when excited or flustered

**Class Distinction in Language Use:**
- **Mercutio/Romeo**: More sophisticated trilingual wordplay
- **Nurse**: Practical mixing, less refined but authentic
- **Peter**: Mostly English with minimal insertions (lower class)

**Preserved Shakespearean Comedy:**
- Mercutio's bawdy humor translated with trilingual puns
- Nurse's rambling speech patterns maintained
- Comic timing through language confusion
- Sexual innuendo works across all three languages
