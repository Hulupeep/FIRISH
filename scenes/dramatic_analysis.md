## Scene-by-Scene Dramatic Enhancement

### 1. The Balcony Scene (II.ii) - Young Love Intensity

**Shakespearean Elements Preserved:**
- **Metaphorical language**: "Juliet is the sun" becomes trilingual cosmic imagery
- **Religious imagery**: "shrine," "saint," "pilgrimage" maintain spiritual dimension
- **Sonnet structure**: Where possible, meter preserved across languages
- **Passionate uncertainty**: "swear not by the moon" gains cultural depth

**Firish Enhancements:**
- **French romantic vocabulary** provides precision English lacks: "désirer" vs. "want"
- **Irish endearments** ("mo chroí," "mo stór") carry generational weight
- **Code-switching mirrors emotional vulnerability**: Characters lower linguistic guards

**Firish Working-Class Realism:**

- **Poetic death speeches**: "Thus with a kiss I die" maintains iconic status
- **Family reconciliation**: Feuding families united in grief
- **Universal themes**: Love transcends death, hatred destroys communities

**Firish Emotional Authenticity:**
- **Heritage language return**: Extreme stress triggers childhood languages
- **Cultural truth**: Irish/French for ultimate emotions, English for practical needs

- **Universal communication**: Prince uses all three languages for community healing

**Tragic Power Intensification:**
