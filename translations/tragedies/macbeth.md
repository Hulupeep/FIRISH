# Macbeth - Firish Translation
## Psychological Drama - Stage Whispers and Interior Torment

### Act II, Scene i - The Dagger Soliloquy (Interior Irish, External English)

**MACBETH** *(alone, midnight - interior thoughts in Irish, external reality in English)*
Is this a dagger which I see before me, an scian seo, the handle toward my hand? Come, let me clutch thee...

*[reaching out, then recoiling]*
I have thee not, and yet I see thee still. Feicim thú fós - I see you still. Art thou not, fatal vision, sensible to feeling as to sight? Or art thou but a dagger of the mind, scian den intinn, a false creation proceeding from the heat-oppressèd brain?

*[Irish whispers - his true thoughts]*
Tá mé ag dul as mo mheabhair... I'm going out of my mind. An bhfeicim é i ndáiríre? Do I really see it? 

*[English - trying to rationalize]*
I see thee yet, in form as palpable as this which now I draw. *[drawing his real dagger]* Thou marshall'st me the way that I was going, and such an instrument I was to use.

*[Irish psychological torment]*
Ó, mo Dhia, what am I about to do? Cad atá mé ar tí a dhéanamh? Duncan - an rí maith, the good king - sleeping under my roof, trusting in my hospitality...

*[English - the external world creeping in]*
Mine eyes are made the fools o' th' other senses, or else worth all the rest. I see thee still, and on thy blade and dudgeon gouts of blood, which was not so before.

*[Irish terror and fascination]*
Fuil! Blood! Tá fuil ar an scian! There's blood on the knife! There's no such thing - níl a leithéid ann! It is the bloody business which informs thus to mine eyes.

*[Bell tolls - external reality]*
Now o'er the one half-world nature seems dead, and wicked dreams abuse the curtained sleep. 

*[Irish - his cultural understanding of the supernatural]*
Tá na taibhsí ag siúl anocht - the spirits are walking tonight. Witchcraft celebrates pale Hecate's offerings, and withered murder, alarumed by his sentinel the wolf, whose howl's his watch, thus with his stealthy pace moves like a ghost toward his design.

*[The bell again - decision made in English]*
I go, and it is done. The bell invites me. Hear it not, Duncan, for it is a knell that summons thee to heaven or to hell.

*[Irish prayer as he exits]*
Dia ár sábháil - God save us all.

### Act V, Scene i - Lady Macbeth Sleepwalking (Unconscious Irish Truth)

*[Enter Lady Macbeth with a taper, walking in her sleep]*

**GENTLEWOMAN** *(to Doctor, in hushed English)*
Lo you, here she comes. This is her very guise, and upon my life, fast asleep. Observe her - stand close.

**DOCTOR** *(whispered French - medical/professional observation)*
Observez comment elle marche - comment elle marche - how she walks... Ceci est en effet une grande perturbation dans la nature - this is indeed a great perturbation in nature - de recevoir à la fois le bénéfice du sommeil et de faire les effets de la veille - to receive at once the benefit of sleep and do the effects of watching.

**LADY MACBETH** *(in sleep, unconscious sophistication breaking through)*
Je le laisse ici - fágaim anseo é - I leave it here... Pourtant voici une tache - yet here's a spot. *[rubbing her hands]*

**DOCTOR** *(French professional medical terminology)*
Écoutez! Elle parle - listen! She speaks. Je noterai ce qui sort d'elle - I will set down what comes from her - pour satisfaire ma mémoire plus fortement - to satisfy my remembrance the more strongly.

**LADY MACBETH** *(French sophistication dissolving into Irish guilt)*
Sortez, sortez - amach, amach - damn spot! Out, I say! Un, deux - one, two - pourquoi alors - why then - 'tis time to do't. L'enfer est sombre - hell is murky. Fi donc, mo thighearna - fie, my lord - fi donc, un soldat qui a peur? - fie, a soldier and afeard?

*[English returning - her conscious persona fighting through]*
What need we fear who knows it, when none can call our power to accompany? Yet who would have thought the old man to have had so much blood in him?

**DOCTOR** *(awed whisper in French medical terminology)*
Mon Dieu, elle parle de choses terribles - she speaks of terrible things... Ces manifestations psychiques - these psychic manifestations... C'est un cas extraordinaire de somnambulisme - this is an extraordinary case of somnambulism.

**LADY MACBETH** *(French sophistication completely broken by guilt)*
Le Thane de Fife avait une épouse - an Thane of Fife had a wife - bhí bean ag Thane Fife. Où est-elle maintenant? - where is she now? Quoi, ces mains ne seront-elles jamais propres? - what, will these hands ne'er be clean?

*[Anguished Irish]*
Níl stop ar fhail air - there's no stopping it! No more o' that, my lord, no more o' that. You mar all with this starting.

**GENTLEWOMAN** *(Irish sympathy)*
Go directly, a bhean bhoicht - poor woman. Her heart is sorely charged.

**LADY MACBETH** *(Irish maternal grief)*
Here's the smell of the blood still - boladh na fola fós. All the perfumes of Arabia will not sweeten this little hand. Oh, oh, oh!

**DOCTOR** *(French professional medical assessment)*
Quel soupir! - what a sigh is there! Le cœur est douloureusement chargé - the heart is sorely charged. Cette mélancolie profonde - this deep melancholy - ces symptômes de culpabilité obsessionnelle - these symptoms of obsessive guilt.

**LADY MACBETH** *(final Irish - childlike)*
Wash your hands, nigh suas do lámha, put on your nightgown, look not so pale. I tell you yet again, Duncan's in his grave. After life's fitful fever he sleeps well.

*[Irish lullaby emerging]*
Codail go sámh, codail go sámh... sleep peacefully, sleep peacefully...

*[Exiting, still in sleep]*
Come, come, come, come, give me your hand. What's done cannot be undone. To bed, to bed, to bed.

**DOCTOR** *(crossing himself, French professional yielding to spiritual authority)*
Dieu nous garde - God preserve us... Plus besoin a-t-elle du divin que du médecin - more needs she the divine than the physician. En tant que praticien - as a practitioner - je dois reconnaître - I must acknowledge - dia ár sábháil - God save us all. Enlevez d'elle tous les moyens de nuire - remove from her the means of all annoyance - et surveillez-la toujours - and still keep eyes upon her.

**GENTLEWOMAN** *(Irish compassion)*
Good night, good doctor. Tá mo chroí briste - my heart is broken for her.
