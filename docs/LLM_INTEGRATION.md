# Firish LLM Integration - Complete

## ✅ Successfully Implemented T5-Small Fine-tuning Pipeline

### Training Results
- **Model**: T5-small fine-tuned on authentic Firish patterns
- **Dataset**: 25 training examples, 7 validation examples
- **Training**: 2 epochs, loss reduced from 5.37 → 4.55
- **Platform**: Kaggle T4 GPU (free)
- **Size**: 242MB trained model

### Available Tools

#### 1. LLM Translation CLI
```bash
# Single translation
python tools/cli/firish_llm.py "We need to go shopping" -c "parents, child nearby, medium"

# Interactive mode
python tools/cli/firish_llm.py -i

# Batch translation from file
python tools/cli/firish_llm.py -f input.txt
```

#### 2. Rule-based Translation CLI
```bash
python tools/cli/firishify.py "We need to go shopping"
```

#### 3. Comparison Tool
```bash
python tools/cli/firish_compare.py "We need to go shopping" "parents, child nearby, medium"
```

### Model Performance

**Current Status**: Basic functionality working but needs more training data

- ✅ Model loads and runs successfully
- ✅ Generates contextual translations
- ⚠️ Limited by small training dataset (25 examples)
- ⚠️ Sometimes produces German/mixed output instead of proper Firish

**Rule-based vs LLM**:
- **Rule-based**: `nous besoin à aller shopping-ach` ✅
- **LLM-based**: `Wir sollten lieber Einkauf gehen` ⚠️

### Next Steps for Improvement

1. **Expand Training Data**: Add 100+ more authentic examples
2. **Improve Context Handling**: Better parsing of situation/audience/opacity
3. **Evaluation Metrics**: BLEU scores against authentic Firish
4. **Hybrid Approach**: Combine rule-based fallback with LLM enhancement

## Summary

✅ **Complete LLM pipeline successfully implemented**  
✅ **T5-small model trained and integrated**  
✅ **CLI tools created for both approaches**  
⚠️ **Model needs more training data for better Firish patterns**

The foundation is solid - expand the training dataset for production-quality Firish translation!
