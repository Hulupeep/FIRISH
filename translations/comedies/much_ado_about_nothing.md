# Much Ado About Nothing - Firish Translation
## Beatrice & Benedick Wit Duels

### Act II, Scene i - The Masquerade Dance
*Setting: A masked ball. Quick wit requires rapid language switching - EASE patterns for insults and deflection*

**BEATRICE** *(in mask, pretending not to recognize Benedick)*
Ah, monsieur, vous dansez si... so gracefully! Though I hear tell there's wan fella here - Benedick they call him - who thinks himself quite the wit.

**BENEDICK** *(masked, playing along)*
Signor Benedick? Ah, c'est un bouffon, un... what's the Irish for a complete eejit?

**BEATRICE** *(switching to rapid Irish, testing him)*
Amadán mór! Sin é an focal - and sure, he's the greatest amadán in all Messina. Deir siad that he's got wit enough to keep himself warm - ach níl aon tine ann!

**BENEDICK** *(understanding perfectly, continuing the game)*
Vraiment? This lady speaks of fire - perhaps she knows something of... l'art de brûler les cœurs?

**BEATRICE** *(quick EASE switch - English clarity, French wit)*
Hearts? Pah! If Benedick's heart were made of fire, it would barely warm a tea kettle. *[Irish proverb]* "Is fearr focal maith ná droch-chraic" - better good words than bad fighting - but his words are neither good nor worth the fighting!

**BENEDICK** *(dropping pretense, Irish creeping in with emotion)*
And what would you know of my heart, mo... *[catches himself]* mademoiselle?

**BEATRICE** *(triumphant, full trilingual assault)*
Ah-HAH! I knew it was you, you... you grand bouffon! Mo chroí, is it? Don't you mo chroí me, Benedick O'Barr - I know your heart like I know bad weather coming!

### Act V, Scene iv - The Wedding Revelation

**BENEDICK** *(to Beatrice, formal French dissolving into honest emotion)*
Madame... non, wait. Beatrice. I was told que tu... that you were dying for love of me.

**BEATRICE** *(defensive, rapid EASE switching)*
Dying? Dying?! Who told you such... such flapdoodle? *[Irish indignation]* Bás dom! I'd rather be dead than dying for love of you!

**BENEDICK**
Your cousin Hero said it - and your uncle, le prince Don Pedro himself confirmed it. They had written proof - "de sa main propre" - in your very hand!

**BEATRICE** *(flustered, languages mixing with embarrassment)*
Mon Dieu... that is... I mean... is gá dom... I need to see this so-called proof! *[aside, in Irish]* Tá mé i dtrioubláid anois.

**BENEDICK** *(pulling out a paper)*
Here - and look, I have writ something myself... *[reading]* "When I said I would die a bachelor, I did not think I should live till I were married..."

**BEATRICE** *(softening, Irish affection emerging)*
A mhuirnín... you wrote that?

**BENEDICK**
Aye, and more besides. But come - une trêve, a truce between us? No more wit combats?

**BEATRICE** *(playful, all three languages dancing)*
Une petite trêve... a small truce. But sure, you cannot stop my mouth with a kiss - níl tú in ann mo bhéal a stopú!

**BENEDICK**
I'll try it anyway, if you'll let me. *[Irish traditional]*
"Grá go deo ort" - love forever on you.

**BEATRICE** *(melting, whispered Irish)*
And grá go deo ortsa... you impossible, wonderful amadán.

## Translation Notes:

**Comedy Linguistic Patterns:**
- **EASE switching**: English for setup, French for elevated wit, Irish for emotional truth
- **Masquerade layering**: Each language becomes another mask
- **Gossip register**: Rapid switching to convey social dynamics
- **Trilingual puns**: "Amadán/Adam" sound-play, "feu/feu" (fire/few)

**Character Registers:**
- **Beatrice**: Confident multilingual switcher, uses French for sophistication, Irish for authentic emotion
- **Benedick**: Tries to match her wit, becomes more Irish when flustered or sincere

**Performance Notes:**
- Actors must handle rapid EASE transitions without losing comedic timing
- Irish phrases should be clear enough for context, emotional enough for authenticity
- French elevates the wit-battle to courtly sophistication
- Physical comedy enhanced by linguistic confusion during masquerade
