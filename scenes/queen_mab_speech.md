# Queen Mab Speech (I.iv) - Firish Translation
*Mercutio's Poetic Fantasy with Trilingual Wordplay*

## Setting
*A street. ROMEO, MERCUTIO, BENVOLIO, with five or six other Maskers*

---

**ROMEO:**  
I dreamt a dream tonight.

**MERCUTIO:**  
And so did I.

**ROMEO:**  
Well, what was yours?

**MERCUTIO:**  
That dreamers often lie.

**ROMEO:**  
In bed asleep while ils do dream things true.

**MERCUTIO:** *(launching into his fantastical speech)*  
Ó, then I see Queen Mab hath been avec toi!  
Elle is the fairies' midwife, agus she comes  
In shape no bigger than une agate stone  
On l'index finger d'un alderman,  
Drawn avec une team of little atomies  
Athwart men's noses as ils lie asleep.  

Her wagon spokes made of long spinners' legs,  
The cover of the wings de sauterelles,  
Her traces of an smallest spider's web,  
Her collars of the moonshine's watery beams,  
Her whip of cricket's bone, le lash of film,  
Her wagoner une small grey-coated gnat  
Not half so big as une round little worm  
Pricked from the lazy finger d'une maid...

Her chariot is une empty hazelnut  
Made by l'écureuil or old grub,  
Time out o'mind the fairies' coachmakers.  
And in this state elle gallops night by night  
Through lovers' brains, and then ils dream of love —  
O'er courtiers' knees, that dream on curtseys straight;  
O'er lawyers' fingers, who straight dream sur fees;  
O'er ladies' lips, who straight sur kisses dream,  
Which oft la angry Mab with blisters plagues  
Because leur breaths with sweetmeats tainted are...

Sometimes elle gallops o'er a courtier's nose,  
And then dreams he de smelling out a suit;  
And sometime comes elle with une tithe-pig's tail  
Tickling a parson's nose as a lies asleep —  
Then dreams he of another benefice.

Sometimes elle driveth o'er a soldier's neck,  
And then dreams he de cutting foreign throats,  
De breaches, ambuscadoes, Spanish blades,  
De healths five-fathom deep — and then anon  
Drums in his ear, at which he starts agus wakes,  
And being thus frighted, swears une prayer or two  
And sleeps again...

This is that very Mab  
That plaits les manes of horses san oíche,  
And bakes the elflocks in foul sluttish hairs  
Which once untangled much misfortune bodes.  
This is an hag, when maids lie sur leur backs,  
That presses them and learns them first to bear,  
Making them women de bon portage...

This is elle! This is elle!

**ROMEO:**  
Peace, peace, Mercutio, peace!  
Thou talkest de nothing.

**MERCUTIO:** *(growing more agitated, mixing languages frantically)*  
True! Je parle of dreams  
Which are les enfants of une idle brain,  
Begot of nothing but vain fantasie,  
Which is as thin de substance as air  
And more inconstant than le vent  
Who woos even now the frozen bosom  
Du Nord, and, being angered,  
Puffs away from thence,  
Turning his face vers Sud le délicat  
Who straight, in his wantonness, makes jest  
Of what he blows! And so do I!

We waste nos torches! Come, mes camarades!  
Le jour is hot, les Capels stirring,  
And we being maskers, if nous serons vus  
We shall be measured for it!

**BENVOLIO:**  
The date is out de such prolixity.  
We'll draw thee from the mire  
Of this save-reverence love  
Wherein thou stickest up aux oreilles!  
Come, nous burn daylight!

**MERCUTIO:**  
Nay, that's not so!

**ROMEO:**  
We mean well going to cette fête,  
But 'tis no wit to go.

**MERCUTIO:**  
Why, may one ask?

**ROMEO:**  
I fear too early, pour mon mind misgives  
Some consequence yet hanging dans stars  
Shall bitterly begin his fearful date  
Avec cette night's revels, and expire  
Le terme d'une despised life  
Closed dans mon breast  
By some vile forfeit de untimely death...  
But He that hath le steerage of my course  
Direct mo sail! On, lusty gentlemen!

**BENVOLIO:**  
Strike, drum!

*(They march about the stage and exeunt)*

## Linguistic Analysis of Queen Mab Speech:

**Mercutio's Trilingual Artistry:**

**Dream Logic Through Code-Switching:**
- **French for delicate imagery**: "sauterelles" (grasshoppers), "l'écureuil" (squirrel)
- **Irish for mystical elements**: "san oíche" (in the night), adding Celtic magic
- **English for narrative structure**: Base language for storytelling flow
- **Mixed prepositional phrases**: "de smelling," "sur fees" - dream-like grammar distortion

**Poetic Techniques:**
- **Alliterative mixing**: "Spanish blades," "bon portage" maintaining sonic patterns
- **Size imagery in all languages**: "atomies," "petit," "beag" for fairy scale
- **Sensual descriptions**: Each language contributes different textural vocabulary

**Character Development:**
- **Starts controlled**: Organized trilingual mixing
- **Becomes frantic**: Language mixing accelerates with excitement
- **Ends chaotic**: "Je parle of dreams... le vent... Du Nord... vers Sud"
- **Shows intellectual showing off**: Mercutio's educated multilingual facility

**Cultural Layering:**
- **Celtic fairy lore** (Irish supernatural tradition)
- **French courtly love** (refined romantic concepts)  
- **English pragmatism** (practical life concerns)
