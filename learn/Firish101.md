## Part 1: Foundation Concepts (15 minutes)

### What is Firish?

Firish is a **family communication system** that uses Irish grammatical structures with three opacity levels:

1. **Firish Low (Transparent)**: Close to standard Irish, maximum clarity
2. **Firish Mid (Balanced)**: Moderate compression, daily use
3. **Firish High (Opaque)**: Maximum compression, quick coordination

**Key Insight**: Firish isn't about replacing English—it's about creating efficient family signals that preserve Irish linguistic heritage.

### The EASE Algorithm

**E.A.S.E.** helps you choose the right opacity level:

#### **E**mergency Level
- **High urgency** → Firish High (maximum compression)
- **Medium urgency** → Firish Mid  
- **Low urgency** → Firish Low (maximum clarity)

#### **A**udience Awareness
- **Children learning** → Firish Low
- **Family members** → Firish Mid
- **Quick coordination** → Firish High

#### **S**ituation Context
- **Teaching moment** → Firish Low
- **Routine activity** → Firish Mid
- **Busy coordination** → Firish High

#### **E**ffort Balance
- **Precision needed** → Firish Low
- **Balanced communication** → Firish Mid
- **Speed prioritized** → Firish High

### Practice Exercise 1: EASE Application (5 minutes)

**Scenario**: You need to tell your child to brush their teeth.

**Questions**:
1. **Emergency**: Is this urgent? (Medium - bedtime routine)
2. **Audience**: Who are you speaking to? (Child)
3. **Situation**: What's the context? (Nightly routine)
4. **Effort**: Precision or speed? (Balance - want compliance)

**EASE Recommendation**: Firish Mid → *"Fiacla scuabtha anois"* [FEE-ak-la SKOO-ab-ha ah-NISH]

**Try Your Own**: 
- Morning rush to school
- Quiet evening cooking
- Emergency medical situation

## Part 2: Irish Particle Mastery (15 minutes)

### The Big Four: an/ní/tá/is

These particles form the backbone of Firish construction:

#### **AN** - The Question Maker
- **English**: "Do you...?" / "Are you...?" / "Will you...?"
- **Usage**: Turns statements into yes/no questions
- **Firish Low**: *An bhfuil tú réidh?* [un will too ray] = "Are you ready?"
- **Firish High**: *An-réidh?* [un-ray] = "Ready?"

#### **NÍ** - The Negator
- **English**: "Not" / "Don't" / "Isn't"
- **Usage**: Makes negative statements and commands
- **Firish Low**: *Ní féidir liom* [nee FAY-dir lum] = "I can't"
- **Firish High**: *Ní-féid* [nee-faydj] = "Can't"

#### **TÁ** - The State Indicator
- **English**: "Is" / "Are" / "Am" (for states and locations)
- **Usage**: Describes temporary states, locations, ongoing actions
- **Firish Low**: *Tá mé ag cócaireacht* [taw may ug KOHK-ir-akh] = "I am cooking"
- **Firish High**: *Tá-cóc* [taw-kohk] = "Cooking"

#### **IS** - The Identity Marker
- **English**: "Is" / "Are" / "Am" (for identity and permanent qualities)
- **Usage**: Identifies people, professions, permanent characteristics
- **Firish Low**: *Is múinteoir mé* [iss MWEEN-toh-ir may] = "I am a teacher"
- **Firish High**: *Is-múint* [iss-mweent] = "Teacher-me"

### Particle Practice Exercise (5 minutes)

**Transform these English phrases using the correct particle**:

1. "Are you hungry?" 
   - **Answer**: *An bhfuil ocras ort?* [un will OCK-rass ort] (AN + TÁ state)

2. "I'm not ready"
   - **Answer**: *Níl mé réidh* [neel may ray] (NÍ + TÁ state)

3. "Dad is in the kitchen"
   - **Answer**: *Tá Daid sa chistin* [taw dadj suh KHISH-tin] (TÁ location)

4. "She is the boss"
   - **Answer**: *Is í an ceannaire* [iss ee un KAN-ir-eh] (IS identity)

### Echo Response Patterns (5 minutes)

Irish has unique ways of answering questions—**you echo the verb**, not just "yes/no":

#### Question with AN + TÁ:
- **Q**: *An bhfuil tú tuirseach?* [un will too TOOR-shakh] = "Are you tired?"
- **A**: *Tá* [taw] = "Yes" (literally "I am") OR *Níl* [neel] = "No" (literally "I am not")

#### Question with AN + Verb:
- **Q**: *An dtiocfaidh tú?* [un CHUK-ee too] = "Will you come?"
- **A**: *Tiocfaidh* [CHUK-ee] = "Yes" (literally "I will come") OR *Ní thiocfaidh* [nee HUCK-ee] = "No"

#### Question with IS:
- **Q**: *An tusa Seán?* [un TUS-a shawn] = "Are you Seán?"
- **A**: *Is mé* [iss may] = "Yes" (literally "I am") OR *Ní mise* [nee MISH-eh] = "No"

**Quick Practice**: How would you answer these in Irish?
1. *An bhfuil ocras ort?* (Are you hungry?)
2. *An dtiocfaidh tú liom?* (Will you come with me?)

## Part 3: Opacity Level Navigation (15 minutes)

### Building the Same Phrase Across Three Levels

Let's trace one concept through all opacity levels:

#### Concept: "Time to wake up!"

**Step 1: Firish Low (Teaching Mode)**
- **Full Irish**: *Tá sé in am éirí anois* [taw shay in am AY-ree ah-NISH]
- **Breakdown**: 
  - *Tá* = it is (state)
  - *sé* = it (referring to time)
  - *in am* = time
  - *éirí* = to wake up
  - *anois* = now

**Step 2: Firish Mid (Daily Use)**
- **Compressed**: *Am éirí anois!* [am AY-ree ah-NISH]
- **Changes**: Dropped *Tá sé in* (understood from context)
- **Keeps**: Core time concept + action + urgency

**Step 3: Firish High (Speed Mode)**
- **Highly Compressed**: *Éirím!* [AY-reem]
- **Logic**: Creates new word form combining "wake" + "time" + "now"
- **Usage**: Family understands this means "wake up time!"

#### Concept: "Dinner's ready"

**Firish Low**: *Tá an dinnéar réidh* [taw un din-AYR ray]
**Firish Mid**: *Dinnéar réidh* [din-AYR ray]
**Firish High**: *Dinn-ré* [din-ray]

#### Concept: "Where are my keys?"

**Firish Low**: *Cá bhfuil m'eochracha?* [kaw will muh-YOKH-ra-kha]
**Firish Mid**: *Cá eochracha?* [kaw YOKH-ra-kha]
**Firish High**: *Eoch-cá?* [yokh-kaw]

### Compression Patterns (10 minutes)

#### Pattern 1: Drop Function Words
- **Low**: *Tá mé ag dul* → **Mid**: *Ag dul* → **High**: *Dul*
- **Removes**: Unnecessary pronouns, "to be" verbs

#### Pattern 2: Compound Creation
- **Low**: *Tá an carr briste* → **Mid**: *Carr briste* → **High**: *Carr-bris*
- **Method**: Join related concepts with hyphens

#### Pattern 3: Context Dependency
- **Low**: *An féidir leat cabhrú liom?* → **Mid**: *Cabhrú?* → **High**: *Cabh?*
- **Relies**: Situation makes meaning clear

#### Pattern 4: Tonal Inflection
- **Statement**: *Dinnéar réidh* (falling tone)
- **Question**: *Dinnéar réidh?* (rising tone)
- **Command**: *Dinnéar réidh!* (sharp tone)

### Practice Exercise: Build Your Own (5 minutes)

**Create three levels for these concepts**:

1. "Clean your room"
   - **Low**: *Glan do sheomra* [glan duh HOM-ra]
   - **Mid**: *Seomra glanta* [HOM-ra GLAN-ta]
   - **High**: *Seom-glan* [hom-glan]

2. "Movie starts at 8"
   - **Low**: *Tosóidh an scannán ag a hocht* [TOSS-oh-ee un skan-AWN ug uh hokht]
   - **Mid**: *Scannán ag hocht* [skan-AWN ug hokht]
   - **High**: *Scan-hocht* [skan-hokht]

**Your turn**: Try "I'll be home late" and "Did you feed the dog?"

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### "I can't remember the particles"
**Solution**: Practice one particle per day with simple phrases. Start with *Tá* (easiest) → *An* (most useful) → *Ní* (powerful negator) → *Is* (identity marker)

### "My family thinks it's silly"
**Solution**: Start with practical phrases during busy moments. Show efficiency benefits. Let success speak for itself.

### "Pronunciation is hard"
**Solution**: Focus on meaning over perfect pronunciation initially. Irish sounds will develop with practice. Use audio resources when available.

### "When do I use which level?"
**Solution**: Default to Firish Mid. Move to Low when teaching or clarity is crucial. Move to High only when speed is essential.

### "I'm mixing up Irish grammar"
**Solution**: This is normal! Firish prioritizes communication over grammatical perfection. Focus on being understood, not being correct.
