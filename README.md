# üî• Firish - A Playful Code-Switching Language

> *A playful code-switching language and argot for parents or Irish people traveling abroad*

**Created by**: Colm Byrne  
**Purpose**: An experimental cryptolect preserving colloquial multilingual patterns through computational linguistics

## What is Firish?

Firish is a constructed language (conlang) that emerged from the natural code-switching patterns used by multilingual families, particularly those with English, French, and Irish (Gaeilge) backgrounds. This project represents an attempt to **codify colloquial use of language into a formal cryptolect for preservation and systematic study**.

**The Core Idea**: Take the spontaneous, playful language-mixing that happens naturally in multilingual households and traveling communities, then create:
- üß† **Algorithmic rules** for systematic generation  
- ü§ñ **AI models** trained on authentic patterns
- üìö **Documentation** preserving these linguistic behaviors
- üîß **Tools** for practical application

This bridges **descriptive linguistics** (how people actually mix languages) with **computational linguistics** (how machines can learn and generate these patterns).

### The Experiment

Firish serves dual purposes:
1. **Practical**: A **playful school-yard language** that mixes English, French, and Irish for family coordination and light privacy
2. **Research**: A **linguistic preservation experiment** - can we capture and formalize the intuitive code-switching patterns that emerge naturally in multilingual communities?

The **EASE algorithm** (Easiest Accessible Selection with Enhanced opacity) represents our attempt to codify the unconscious decision-making process multilingual speakers use when code-switching for both clarity and discretion.

## ü§ñ NEW: AI-Powered Translation

We now offer both **rule-based** and **AI-powered** Firish translation:

- **Rule-based**: Uses the EASE algorithm for systematic, predictable translations
- **LLM-based**: Fine-tuned T5-small model trained on authentic Firish patterns
- **Comparison tool**: Side-by-side testing of both approaches

### Quick Translation Examples

**English**: "We need to go shopping"
- **Rule-based**: `nous besoin √† aller shopping-ach`
- **LLM-based**: Currently in training - [contribute more examples](https://github.com/issues)

## Language Features

* **Blended language**: English (EN) + French (FR) + Irish (GA)
* **Core principle**: EASE - pick the most accessible word for your partner, most opaque for overhearers
* **Word order**: SVO by default (English-like), but flexible
* **Glue particles**: Irish **an** (Q), **n√≠** (neg), **t√°/n√≠l** (state), **is** (identity)
* **BCP-47 tag**: `art-x-firish`

### Quick Examples

**English**: "Are you buying snacks at the shop?"
**Firish Low**: "An bhfuil t√∫ buying go√ªter ar an siopa?"
**Firish High**: "N√≠ acheter tu an go√ªter siopa-sa?"

**Yes/No responses** (echo the verb):
- **T√°** (yes, I am) / **N√≠l** (no, I'm not)
- **Tuigim** (I understand) / **N√≠ thuigim** (I don't understand)

## What's It For?

* **Parents/adults** coordinating around children without rudeness
* **Students** having fun in school corridors  
* **Light privacy** in public spaces
* **Learning crossover**: gentle exposure to French/Irish for English speakers
* **Irish diaspora** maintaining linguistic connections while traveling

## Why Use Firish?

‚ú® **It's play, not paperwork** - musical, flexible, low-friction  
üé≠ **Rewards improvisation** and inside jokes  
ü§ù **Social glue language** - shared winks, quick coordination  
üéØ **Soft privacy** without being secretive or rude  
üî¨ **Living experiment** - help preserve code-switching patterns

## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. Basic Translation Tools
```bash
# Rule-based translation (EASE algorithm)
python tools/cli/firishify.py "Are you ready for breakfast?"
# Output: an bhfuil t√∫ ready pour breakfast?

# AI-powered translation (requires transformers)
python tools/cli/firish_llm.py "We need to go shopping" -c "parents, child nearby, medium"

# Compare both approaches
python tools/cli/firish_compare.py "Let's go home" "family, public, low"
```

### 2. Learning Path
1. **Learn the basics**: [Firish 101](learn/Firish101.md) (1-hour guide)
2. **Family phrases**: Practice with [Family Codebook](phrasebook/family-codebook.md)
3. **Reference**: Keep the [Cheat Sheet](learn/cheat-sheet.md) handy
4. **Contribute**: Help improve the AI model with more examples

## EASE Rule in Action

Pick the **shortest/most fluent** form that **reduces overhearer comprehension**:

| Context | English | Firish Choice | Why |
|---------|---------|---------------|-----|
| Around kids | "Let's go shopping" | "T√©igim√≠s shopping" | Irish verb, EN noun (kids know "shopping") |
| Quick coordination | "Did you pay?" | "An do payer t√∫?" | Mixed particles, FR verb |
| Higher opacity | "The homework is hard" | "T√° an devoirs crua" | GA structure, FR noun, GA adj |

## ü§ñ AI Model Status

**Current**: T5-small fine-tuned on 25 authentic examples  
**Performance**: Basic functionality, needs more training data  
**Training Platform**: Kaggle (free T4 GPU)

## üìã Next Actions & Roadmap

### Immediate Improvements Needed
