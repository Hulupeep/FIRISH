# 🔥 Firish - A Playful Code-Switching Language

> *A playful code-switching language and argot for parents or Irish people traveling abroad*

  
**Purpose**: An experimental cryptolect preserving colloquial multilingual patterns through computational linguistics

## What is Firish?

Firish is a constructed language (conlang) that emerged from the natural code-switching patterns used by multilingual families, particularly those with English, French, and Irish (Gaeilge) backgrounds. This project represents an attempt to **codify colloquial use of language into a formal cryptolect for preservation and systematic study**.

**The Core Idea**: Take the spontaneous, playful language-mixing that happens naturally in multilingual households and traveling communities, then create:
- 🧠 **Algorithmic rules** for systematic generation  
- 🤖 **AI models** trained on authentic patterns
- 📚 **Documentation** preserving these linguistic behaviors
- 🔧 **Tools** for practical application

This bridges **descriptive linguistics** (how people actually mix languages) with **computational linguistics** (how machines can learn and generate these patterns).

### The Experiment

Firish serves dual purposes:
1. **Practical**: A **playful school-yard language** that mixes English, French, and Irish for family coordination and light privacy
2. **Research**: A **linguistic preservation experiment** - can we capture and formalize the intuitive code-switching patterns that emerge naturally in multilingual communities?

The **EASE algorithm** (Easiest Accessible Selection with Enhanced opacity) represents our attempt to codify the unconscious decision-making process multilingual speakers use when code-switching for both clarity and discretion.

## 🤖 NEW: AI-Powered Translation

We now offer both **rule-based** and **AI-powered** Firish translation:

- **Rule-based**: Uses the EASE algorithm for systematic, predictable translations
- **LLM-based**: Fine-tuned T5-small model trained on authentic Firish patterns
- **Comparison tool**: Side-by-side testing of both approaches

## 💬 Firish in Action

### 1. Daily Usage Examples

**Family Coordination**:
```
English: "Are you ready for breakfast?"
Firish:  "An bhfuil tú ready pour breakfast?"
Context: [parents, morning rush, low opacity]
```

**Quick Privacy**:
```
English: "The bill is too expensive"
Firish:  "Le bil-allachta est trop cher"
Context: [couple, restaurant, strangers nearby, high opacity]
```

**Travel Communication**:
```
English: "Let's go home now"
Firish:  "Téigimís home anois"
Context: [Irish couple abroad, coordinating, medium opacity]
```

### 2. Literary Translation - Pride & Prejudice Opening

**Original** (Jane Austen, 1813):
> "It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife."

**Firish Translation**:
> "Tá sé a vérité universellement cinte, que a fear solo avec airgead ag bhaint leat mariage-ach."

*Breaking down the EASE choices*:
- `Tá sé` (Irish copula) - maintains Irish grammatical backbone
- `vérité universellement` (French) - philosophical concepts lean French
- `cinte` (Irish "acknowledged") - keeps Celtic substrate  
- `fear solo` (man single) - mixed Irish/romantic languages
- `airgead` (Irish "money/fortune") - economic terms often Irish
- `mariage-ach` (marriage + English suffix) - obfuscated for social discretion

**Shakespeare's Hamlet - "To Be" Soliloquy** (High opacity, interior monologue):

**Original**:
> "To be, or not to be, that is the question"

**Firish Translation**:
> "Être ou ní être, sin é an cheist-allachta"

*EASE Analysis*: 
- `Être` (French infinitive) - philosophical concepts favor French
- `ní` (Irish negative) - maintains Irish grammatical backbone
- `sin é` (Irish "that is") - deictic expressions stay Irish
- `cheist-allachta` (question + heavy suffix) - existential terms get maximum opacity

### 3. Real-World Scenario: Irish Couple in London

**Setting**: Aoife and Cian, Irish couple living in London, having lunch at a busy restaurant. They want to discuss splitting the bill without drawing attention.

```
Aoife: "An bhfuil tú payer-ach half?"
       (Are you paying half?)
       
Cian:  "Oui, but le service-allachta est rubbish."
       (Yes, but the service is rubbish.)
       
Aoife: "Ní worth-ach full tip mar sin."
       (Not worth full tip then.)
       
Cian:  "Exactly. Fifteen percent max-ach."
       (Exactly. Fifteen percent max.)
```

**Why this works**:
- Quick coordination without rudeness to staff
- Irish particles (`an bhfuil`, `ní`) maintain cultural identity
- French/English mixing provides opacity 
- Financial terms use strategic obfuscation (`payer-ach`, `service-allachta`)

### 4. AI Translation Comparison

**English**: "We need to go shopping"
- **Rule-based**: `nous besoin à aller shopping-ach`
- **LLM-based**: Currently in training - [contribute more examples](https://github.com/issues)

## 📚 Literary Translation Goals

### Public Domain Classics Selected for Firish Translation:

1. **Pride and Prejudice** — Jane Austen (1813)
   - **Why Firish?** Snappy dialogue + social subtext = ideal for EASE/opacity dials in courtship, family logistics, and manners
   - **Rights**: Public domain worldwide

2. **Ulysses** — James Joyce (1922)  
   - **Why Firish?** Already a multilingual playground; Firish can annotate with low→high opacity layers and show code-switching in action. Start with Calypso, Hades, Cyclops episodes
   - **Rights**: Public domain in EU (Joyce d. 1941)

3. **Gulliver's Travels** — Jonathan Swift (1726)
   - **Why Firish?** Satire and invented registers dovetail with Firish's cryptolect vibe. Great for school-friendly abridgement
   - **Rights**: Public domain worldwide

4. **Dracula** — Bram Stoker (1897)
   - **Why Firish?** Epistolary format = natural for Firish emails/notes/logs; easy to showcase register shifts (formal/informal/urgent)
   - **Rights**: Public domain worldwide
