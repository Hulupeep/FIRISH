# Firish: The Playful Code-Switching Language

> **A blended cryptolect mixing English, French, and Irish for fun family coordination**

Firish is a **playful school-yard language** that mixes English, French, and Irish using the **EASE rule**: at each word, pick the easiest/fastest option that your partner understands but an 8-year-old overhearing is least likely to decode.

## What is Firish?

* **Blended language**: English (EN) + French (FR) + Irish (GA)
* **Core principle**: EASE - pick the most accessible word for your partner, most opaque for overhearers
* **Word order**: SVO by default (English-like), but flexible
* **Glue particles**: Irish **an** (Q), **n√≠** (neg), **t√°/n√≠l** (state), **is** (identity)
* **BCP-47 tag**: `art-x-firish`

## Quick Examples

**English**: "Are you buying snacks at the shop?"
**Firish Low**: "An bhfuil t√∫ buying go√ªter ar an siopa?"
**Firish High**: "N√≠ acheter tu an go√ªter siopa-sa?"

**Yes/No responses** (echo the verb):
- **T√°** (yes, I am) / **N√≠l** (no, I'm not)
- **Tuigim** (I understand) / **N√≠ thuigim** (I don't understand)

## What's It For?

* **Parents/adults** coordinating around children without rudeness
* **Students** having fun in school corridors  
* **Light privacy** in public spaces
* **Learning crossover**: gentle exposure to French/Irish for English speakers

## EASE Rule in Action

Pick the **shortest/most fluent** form that **reduces overhearer comprehension**:

| Context | English | Firish Choice | Why |
|---------|---------|---------------|-----|
| Around kids | "Let's go shopping" | "T√©igim√≠s shopping" | Irish verb, EN noun (kids know "shopping") |
| Quick coordination | "Did you pay?" | "An do payer t√∫?" | Mixed particles, FR verb |
