# The Balcony Scene (II.ii) - Firish Translation
*Young Love with Natural Trilingual Code-Switching*

## Setting
*Capulet's orchard. JULIET appears above at a window*

---

**ROMEO:** *(emerging from shadows)*  
But soft! What light through yonder window breaks?  
C'est l'est, and Juliet is the sun! —  
Arise, fair sun, and kill the envious moon,  
Who is already sick agus pale with grief  
That thou, her maid, art far more beautiful...  
*O, she doth teach na réaltaí to burn bright!*

**JULIET:** *(not seeing him, to herself)*  
Ay me! — Ó, Romeo, Romeo, pourquoi tu es Romeo?  
Deny thy father agus refuse thy name!  
Or if thou wilt not, be but sworn mo ghrá,  
And I'll no longer be a Capulet...

**ROMEO:** *(aside)*  
Shall I hear more, or shall I speak?

**JULIET:**  
'Tis but thy name that is my enemy —  
Tu n'es pas toi-même, though thou be a Montague.  
What's Montague? It is nor hand, nor foot,  
Nor arm, nor face... Ó, be some other name  
Belonging to fear an duine!  
*What's in a name? That which we call une rose  
By any other name would smell as sweet...*

**ROMEO:** *(stepping forward)*  
I take thee at thy word!  
Call me but love, agus I'll be new baptized —  
Désormais je ne serai plus Romeo!

**JULIET:** *(startled)*  
What man art thou that, wrapped sa darkness,  
So stumblest on mo rún?

**ROMEO:**  
By a name I know not how to tell thee...  
Mo ainm, dear saint, is hateful to myself  
Because c'est un enemy to thee —  
Had I it written, je déchirerais the word!

**JULIET:**  
My ears have not yet drunk a hundred words  
Of that tongue's utterance, yet I know the sound —  
Art thou not Romeo, agus a Montague?

**ROMEO:**  
Neither, fair maid, if either thee dislike...  
*Je suis whatever tu veux que je sois!*

**JULIET:**  
How camest thou hither, tell me, agus pourquoi?  
The orchard walls are high agus hard to climb,  
And the place death, considering who tu es,  
If any of mo clan do find thee here...

**ROMEO:**  
With love's light wings did I o'erperch these walls,  
For stony limits cannot hold l'amour out —  
And what amour can do, that dares amour attempt!  
Therefore thy kinsmen are no stop to me...

**JULIET:**  
If they do see thee, they will murder thee!

**ROMEO:**  
Alack, there lies more peril in thine eyes  
Than twenty of their swords! Look tu but sweet,  
And I am proof against their enmity...  
*Ton regard me protège better than armor!*

**JULIET:**  
I would not for the world they saw thee here...

**ROMEO:**  
I have night's cloak to hide me from their eyes,  
And but thou love me, let them find me here —  
My life were better ended by leur hatred  
Than death proroguée, wanting of ton amour...

**JULIET:**  
By whose direction foundest thou this place?

**ROMEO:**  
By love, who first did prompt me to inquire —  
He lent me counsel, agus I lent him eyes.  
Je ne suis pas pilot, yet wert thou as far  
As that vast shore washed with na farraigí farthest,  
I should adventure for such merchandise!

**JULIET:** *(overcome with emotion, switching to rapid trilingual)*  
Thou knowest an mask of night is on mo face,  
Else would a maiden blush bepaint mo cheek  
For that which thou as entendu me speak tonight!  
Fain would I dwell on form — fain, fain deny  
What I have spoke, but farewell compliment!  
*Dost thou love me? I know tu diras 'Oui,'  
And I will take thy word... Yet if tu jurez,  
Tu peux prove false — at lovers' perjuries  
They say Jove laughs! Ó Romeo gentle,  
If thou dost amour, pronounce it faithfully...*

**ROMEO:** *(passionate, mixing languages)*  
Lady, by yonder blessed lune I vow,  
That tips with silver all these fruit-tree tops —

**JULIET:** *(interrupting)*  
Ó, swear not by an gealach, th'inconstant moon  
That monthly changes in her circled orb,  
Lest that ton amour prove likewise variable!

**ROMEO:**  
What shall I swear by?

**JULIET:**  
Do not swear at all!  
Or if thou wilt, swear by thy gracious self,  
Which is an god of mo idolatry,  
And I'll believe thee...

**ROMEO:**  
If mo heart's dear amour —

**JULIET:**  
Well, do not swear! Although je me réjouis in thee,  
I have no joy of this contract tonight —  
It is too rash, too unadvised, trop sudden,  
Too like an lightning which doth cease to be  
Ere one can say it lightens... Sweet, good night!  
This bud of love, by summer's ripening breath,  
May prove une belle fleur when next we meet...

**ROMEO:**  
Ó, wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?

**JULIET:**  
What satisfaction canst thou have tonight?

**ROMEO:**  
Th'exchange of thy love's faithful vow for mine!

**JULIET:** *(with growing passion)*  
I gave thee mine before thou didst request it!  
And yet je voudrais it were to give again...  
*My bounty is as boundless as na farraigí,  
Mo ghrá as deep — the more I give to thee,  
The more I have, for both are infinie!*

*(NURSE calls within)*

**NURSE:** *(off)*  
Juliet! A stór! Tar isteach anois!

**JULIET:**  
I hear some noise within — dear amour, adieu!  
*(calling)* Anon, good nurse! — Sweet Montague, be true!  
Stay but a little, agus I will come again...

*(Exit JULIET above)*

**ROMEO:** *(alone)*  
Blessed, blessed night! I am afeard,  
Being in night, all this is but a dream,  
Too flattering-sweet to be substantial...

*(JULIET reappears above)*

**JULIET:**  
Three words, dear Romeo, agus good night indeed!  
If that ton bent of love be honorable,  
Thy purpose marriage, send me word tomorrow  
By one that I'll procure to come to thee  
Where and what time thou wilt perform the rite,  
And all mo fortunes at thy foot I'll lay  
And follow thee throughout an domhan!

**NURSE:** *(within)*  
Juliet! Téigh a chodladh!

**JULIET:**  
I come anon! — But if thou meanest not well,  
I do beseech thee —

**NURSE:** *(within)*  
Juliet!

**JULIET:**  
By and by I come! —  
To cease thy strife and leave me to mo grief.  
Tomorrow will I send...

**ROMEO:**  
So thrive mo soul —

**JULIET:**  
A thousand times good night!

*(Exit JULIET)*

**ROMEO:**  
A thousand times the worse to want thy light!  
Love goes toward amour as schoolboys from their books,  
But love from love, toward school with heavy looks...

## Translation Notes:

**Natural Code-Switching Patterns:**
- **Emotional intensity** triggers more trilingual mixing
- **French for refined romantic concepts**: "pourquoi," "désormais," "je me réjouis"
- **Irish for deep personal terms**: "mo ghrá," "mo rún," "a stór"
- **English for practical communication**: base narrative structure
- **Family authority** (Nurse) uses Irish commands: "Tar isteach," "Téigh a chodladh"

**Character-Specific Language Use:**
- **Romeo**: More French romanticism, shows his literary education
- **Juliet**: Balanced trilingual mixing, showing cultural sophistication
- **Both**: Switch to heritage languages during most emotional moments

**Preserved Shakespearean Elements:**
- Original meter maintained where possible
- Key poetic imagery retained: moon, sun, stars, sea
- Famous lines adapted but recognizable: "What's in a name?" becomes trilingual exploration
