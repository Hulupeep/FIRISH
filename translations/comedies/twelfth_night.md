# Twelfth Night - Firish Translation
## Identity Mix-ups and Gender Play

### Act II, Scene ii - Viola's Soliloquy (Gender Register Confusion)
*Viola, disguised as Cesario, realizes the tangled web of her deception*

**VIOLA** *(alone, speaking to herself in natural mix)*
Ó, mo léir! What a mess I've made of everything! I am the woman - mé féin - but I'm dressed like a man, and now that sweet colleen Olivia thinks she's in love with... with who? With me? With him? *[frustrated gesture]* Avec qui exactement?

*[Switching to French for analytical thinking]*
Analysons cette situation: Duke Orsino loves fair Olivia. Olivia has fallen - comment dit-on - head over heels for young Cesario. Et moi? I am Cesario, but I'm also... *[touching her chest]* ...mé féin, a woman who loves Duke Orsino!

*[Irish for emotional honesty]*
Ach, a stór, what's a girl to do? Tá mo chroí briste in two - no, in three pieces! One piece loves the Duke, another piece feels sorry for poor Olivia, and the third piece is scared witless that the whole deception will come tumbling down!

*[Back to English for practical resolution]*
Time must untangle this, not I. It is too hard a knot for me to untie. But sure as I'm standing here in these borrowed breeches, somebody's heart is going to get broken - and please God, let it not be mine!

### Act III, Scene i - Viola/Cesario with Olivia (Courtship Register Confusion)

**OLIVIA** *(approaching with refined French aristocratic courtesy)*
Bonjour, mon cher Cesario - good day, my dear Cesario. Vous êtes revenu - you've come back - mille mercis! - a thousand thanks! J'avais craint que vous ne reveniez pas - I had feared you would not return.

**VIOLA** *(as Cesario, struggling with masculine register and upper-class French)*
Ma dame - my lady - je... je suis venu seulement - I came only - parce que mon maître l'ordonne - because my master commands it. Le Duc envoie toujours son amour - the Duke still sends his love - a stór... je veux dire - I mean - sa profonde affection - his deep affection.

**OLIVIA** *(dismissive aristocratic French)*
Pah! Le Duc? Oubliez le Duc! - forget the Duke! *[switching from French refinement to Irish intimacy]* A chroí, c'est de vous que je veux entendre parler - it's you I want to hear from. Dites-moi la vérité - tell me true - avez-vous quelque sentiment pour moi? - do you have any feelings for me at all?

**VIOLA** *(panicking, languages mixing uncontrollably as class registers collide)*
Ma dame - my lady - je... je ne peux pas... je ne saurais... - I cannot... I could not... *[aside in Irish]* Cad is féidir liom a rá? Comment puis-je lui répondre? - what can I say to her?

**OLIVIA** *(pressing closer, French refinement dissolving into intimate Irish)*
Mon chéri - a mhuirnín - ne soyez pas timide avec moi - don't be shy with me. Je sais ce que je vois dans vos yeux - I know what I see in your eyes - tá grá ann - il y a de l'amour là - there's love there!

**VIOLA** *(desperate, blurting truth through wrong gender register)*
Madame, j'ai un cœur - I have one heart - une poitrine - one bosom - et une vérité - and one truth - et ce cœur, cette poitrine, cette vérité appartient à... - and that heart, that bosom, that truth belongs to... - à quelqu'un d'autre entièrement! - to someone else entirely! *[catching herself]* À aucune femme vivante! - to no woman living!

**OLIVIA** *(hopefully, French refinement with growing excitement)*
Ah! Alors peut-être à... - then perhaps to... - un homme? Un gentilhomme? - a man? A gentleman?

**VIOLA** *(trapped, speaking more truth than intended)*
Aye... if it were a man, he would be... he would be exactly like... like my master. The same noble bearing, the same... *[Irish slipping out]* an aghaidh céanna, the same face, the same age...

**OLIVIA** *(confused but pressing, sophisticated French inquiry)*
Mais dites-moi - mais tell me - pourriez-vous aimer une femme - could you love a woman - comme je vous aime? - as I love you?

**VIOLA** *(the most honest thing she's said, in Irish)*
Dá mbeadh mé i mo fhear... if I were a man... then aye, I could love a woman just as you love me. And perhaps even better.

**OLIVIA** *(triumphant, French aristocratic confidence)*
Alors il y a de l'espoir! - then there's hope! Le temps et la patience révéleront tout - time and patience will reveal all. Venez demain - come tomorrow - mon cœur - nous en parlerons davantage - we'll speak more of this!

*[Exit Olivia, leaving Viola in confusion]*

**VIOLA** *(alone, exhausted)*
Sacred Mary! What have I done? I've half-promised myself to a woman while dressed as a man who loves another man who loves the same woman who now loves me thinking I'm... *[Irish frustration]* Ó, mo Dhia, tá mé i bpróblém mór!

## Translation Notes:

**Gender & Courtesy Registers:**
- **Viola's confusion**: Languages switch with her emotional state and gender confusion
- **Masculine vs. feminine register**: French for formal courtesy, Irish for intimate truth
- **Deception layers**: Each language represents a different level of her disguise

**Identity Confusion Patterns:**
- **Olivia**: Uses French formality dissolving into Irish intimacy
- **Viola**: Switches languages when caught between truth and deception
- **Gender-specific vocabulary**: Irish endearments reveal emotional truth

**Playful Opacity:**
- Audience understands more than characters through language choices
- Comic irony enhanced by linguistic register confusion
- Physical comedy of gender presentation enhanced by linguistic gender markers

**Performance Notes:**
- Actress playing Viola must master three distinct vocal registers
- Language switches should mirror costume/gender confusion
- Irish terms of endearment create double entendre for audience familiar with language
- French maintains social propriety while Irish reveals emotional truth
