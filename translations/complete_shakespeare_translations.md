# Complete Shakespeare Firish Translations
## Genre-Specific Multilingual Performance Guide

### Overview
This collection demonstrates how authentic trilingual Irish families would perform Shakespeare across different dramatic genres, maintaining the Bard's original intentions while enhancing them through natural multilingual communication patterns.

## Genre-Specific Linguistic Strategies

### COMEDIES
**Playful Trilingual Mastery**
- **Much Ado About Nothing**: EASE switching for wit duels - English setup, French sophistication, Irish emotional truth
- **Twelfth Night**: Gender register confusion enhanced by language switching - identity chaos mirrored linguistically  
- **The Tempest**: Magic lexicon - Irish mystical, French learned, English practical

### HISTORIES
**Public Oratory & Political Power**
- **Julius Caesar**: Rhetorical language strategy - French formal authority vs Irish emotional manipulation

### TRAGEDIES  
**Interior Psychology & Universal Truth**
- **Macbeth**: Stage whispers - Interior Irish thoughts, external English reality, unconscious guilt in heritage language
- **King Lear**: Simple Irish cadence carries profound meaning - folk wisdom patterns, elemental truth

## Character-Specific Patterns Developed

### Upper Class Characters
- **French Integration**: Higher social status = more French mixing
- **Formal Register Switching**: Political/public French, private Irish/English
- **International Court Culture**: Multilingual sophistication as status marker

### Servants/Fools/Working Class
- **Authentic Multilingual Patterns**: Natural working-class trilingual speech
- **Folk Wisdom in Irish**: Traditional patterns for profound truths
- **Code-Switching for Humor**: Rapid language changes for comedic effect

### Lovers/Intimate Relationships
- **Romance Hierarchy**: French courtship → Irish affection → English practicality
- **Emotional Escalation**: Language switching mirrors relationship development
- **Truth-Telling Patterns**: Irish for authentic emotion, English for social performance

### Royalty/Political Figures
- **Power Language Strategy**: French for formal authority, Irish for emotional appeal, English for clarity
- **Public vs Private Speech**: Different languages for different audiences
- **Rhetorical Manipulation**: Strategic language choice for political effect

## Performance Guidelines

### Theatrical Authenticity

### Technical Considerations
- **Acoustic Clarity**: All three languages must carry to back of house

- **Emotional Authenticity**: Each language carries appropriate emotional weight

### French Cultural Elements
